        "             -> Memory management in Python is automatic and handled by the interpreter. Python mainly uses reference counting along with a cyclic garbage collector to allocate and deallocate memory. While automatic memory management makes programming easier, it also introduces several challenges.\n",

        "1. Dependency on Reference Counting\n",
        "\n",
        "Python primarily uses reference counting to track objects in memory.\n",
